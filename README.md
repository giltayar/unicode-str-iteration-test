# unicode-str-iteration-test
Code from medium article about iterating over unicode characters

## Building
Run `npm run build`

## Running
Either run the ES6 version using:
```sh
node unicode.js
```
Or run the ES5 version using:
```sh
node es5-unicode.js
```

Note that to verify that everything _really_ works in ES5, you should install node v0.10, e.g. `nvm install 0.10`.
